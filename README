This theme was created while working on my Scala Textmate Bundle so it's probably best suited for Scala development. However I use for all of my coding activities so it might suit your needs as well :) 

I use the font: Bitstream Vera Sans Mono 12pt and I suggest that you do as well because it's just plain awesome. It's a free font and you should be able to download it here: http://www.dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font
